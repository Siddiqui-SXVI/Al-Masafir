<h2>Kuldhara</h2><br><br>


<h3>About Kuldhara</h3><br>
<p>An abandoned ghost town, Kuldhara was once a prosperous town occupied by Paliwal Brahmins. The reasons for why a whole city was abandoned within a night is not clear but the popular belief holds the then state minister Salim Singh responsible for the same. The minister wanted to marry the village chief’s daughter and therefore delivered an ultimatum to the village chief to accept his demands or let the whole community face dire consequences. Rather than giving in to the minister’s demands, the whole village decided to move away. Before leaving, they cursed this place to never have any kind of human settlement and this has been proven true to this date. Visit Kuldhara to get a glimpse of the past and get spooked by its tales.</p>
